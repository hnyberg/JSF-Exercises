# JSF-Exercises
### Exercises to practice Java Server Faces

#### <em>Exercise 1</em>

Create a project with input.xhtml, output.xhtml and a Managed Bean.
The input file should be a form with 2-3 different kinds of inputs (your choice!) and a button.
When the user click the button, the input data is displayed in the output file.
Use a Managed Bean for managing the transmitted data.

#### <em>Exercise 2</em>

We still need a input.xhtml and output.xhtml.
The input file is a form with two fields for entering two numbers.
The bean should store the two numbers, sum them up and then display the result in the output file.

#### <em>Exercise 3</em>

Create a project that has PizzaCalculatorJSF input.xhtml, output.xhtml and a Managed Bean class. The input form should include:
<ul>
	<li>Dropdown menu for choice of pizza bottom</li>
	<li>8-10 checkboxes for choice of pizza toppings</li>
	<li>Radiobuttons to select pizza size</li>
	<li>Textfields for user to enter name and phone number</li>
	<li>Radiobutton to choose delivery method</li>
</ul>
When you click on the submit button you come to the output file where all of one's choices are listed, how much they cost and what the total cost will be.
